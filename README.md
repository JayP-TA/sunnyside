### What I learned

This is the first personal project for my portfolio, it has helped me feel more confident in my abilities to make good loking, responsive, functional and accesible websites from scratch.
Below is a code snippet of the CSS I used to do the underline for the "Learn More" anchors.
```css
.grid-item-1 a {
  font-family: Fraunces;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 13px;
  color: black;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 1px;
  text-align: left;
  background-position: bottom center;
  background-clip: padding-box;
  padding: 0 0.5em 0;
  background-size: 200px 5px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  transition: all .3s;
}

.grid-item-1 a:hover, .grid-item-1 a:active, .grid-item-1 a:focus{
  background-size: 200px 17px;
} 
```
### Continued development

In the future I will be revisiting this project to add more detail and refactor any code that isn't very maintainable.
